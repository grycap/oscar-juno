# JUNO 

This project is a module that enables the use of Jupyter Notebook inside the [OSCAR](https://oscar.grycap.net/) cluster, allowing users to interact with the cluster, through its [python client](https://github.com/grycap/oscar_python).  

It also includes support for [Elyra](https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra) and [APRICOT](https://github.com/grycap/apricotlab) (Advanced Platform for Reproducible Infrastructure in the Cloud via Open Tools).

## Forms of use

To use this module from the OSCAR cluster, you simply need to enter the cluster web UI and then go to `Nootebooks` â†’ `Deploy`.

You also can take the `juno.yaml` and `script.sh`, presents in this project and deploy it as an OSCAR service.

## Examples

If you go to the examples directory, you can find a simple tutorial that will teach you how to use OSCER through Jupyter Notebooks with two basic use cases.

It will show you how to:
- Set up the notebook environment.
- Create and call a synchronous service. 
- Create and call an asynchronous service.
- Delete the created services.
